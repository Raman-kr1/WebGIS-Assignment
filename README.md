2.  **Clone this repository:**
   `git clone https://github.com/Raman-kr1/WebGIS-Assignment.git`
`cd WebGIS-Assignment`

3.**Run via a Local Server:** 
For avoid CORS issues:
Run via - vscode Live server or `python3 -m http.server 8000`


4. **Test the Application:**

## Tools/Libraries Used


- Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap Tiles, Tailwind CSS, GeoJSON

## What I Learned

- **Web Mapping with Leaflet:**  
I learned how to load GeoJSON data into a Leaflet map, apply styles to map layers, and bind interactive popups to each geographic feature.

- **Dynamic Data Handling:**  
Generating dummy population data, updating the sidebar with state statistics, and fetching local data files reinforced how to manipulate and display data dynamically using JavaScript.

- **Responsive Design using Tailwind CSS:**  
I discovered how to efficiently create a responsive layout with Tailwind CSS that works across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices with minimal custom styling.

- **Debugging and Troubleshooting:**  
Through this project, I encountered common issues such as CORS errors, property mismatches in GeoJSON, and problems related to variable scope. I learned to debug these issues effectively using browser developer tools, console logging, and careful testing.

- **Local Server Requirement:**  
I gained an understanding of why running a project on a local server (rather than directly opening HTML files) is necessary due to browser CORS policies and how to set up a simple local server using tools like VS Codeâ€™s Live Server or Pythonâ€™s HTTP server.
